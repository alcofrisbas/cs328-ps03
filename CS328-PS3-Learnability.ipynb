    "We discussed in class that half lines are PAC-learnable. The same argument came be made for learning concepts along one feature dimension. For example, I might want to learn when it's time to transplant my tomato plants, and the only feature that matters for transplant is how tall the tomato is: there's a range starting at height $h_{1}$ and going until height $h_{2}$ where I should transplant the tomato, and tomatos that are outside that range (too short or too tall) should not be transplated. Argue that the cass of concepts that could represent transplantable tomato plants is PAC-learnable. Your answer does not need to be as rigorous as a formal proof, but should be clear about what you need to show and justify how you can show it for this concept (this could include why it's analogous to the half line concept).\n",
