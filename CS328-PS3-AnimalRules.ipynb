    "The more features that are considered, the better the model does. This is why knowing all or 20 features models outperform the 5 feature models. This makes sense because when a model knows more features, it can eliminate more animals each round of guessing. In regards to performance, humans perform most cloesly to 'know 5 features' model. The furthest is the 'know all features model.' However, I don't think that the 'know 5 features' model is the closest to the way humans do this test. When I played the game, I think my errors had less to do with not knowing features (which I almost always knew all of them) and more to do with flawed or lazy elimination of animals. However, its for this same reason that I think that the 'knowing all the features' method is the most different because there is no way I considered every single feature when I am eliminating animals.

    "In <tt>animal_guessing_game.py</tt>, write a function <tt>find_simplest_rule(target_animal, animal_names, features_names, feature_matrix)</tt> which takes as parameters an animal name, a list of animal names, a list of feature names, and a binary 2-dimensional list of animal-feature pairs (the feature matrix); as in previous parts, each inner list is one animal. This function should find the simplest conjunctive rule for identifying the given animal. A rule identifies an animal if it is true for the target animal and false for all other animals. The rule may include conjunctions of features or their negations. For example, the rule \"lean and not strainteeth\" would include all animals that have the feature lean and do not have the feature strainteeth. Your function should return a dictionary that has two keys: positive_features, where the value is a list of the names of features that are not negated; and negative_features, where the value is a list of the names of features that are negated. For example, the rule above would be represented by the following dictionary: <tt>{\"positive_features\" : [\"lean\"], \"negative_features\" : [\"strainteeth\"]}</tt>. The dictionary should return the simplest rule that identifies the target animal. The simplest rule is defined as the one that contains the fewest features (whether or not they are negated).\n",

For instance, even if you perfectly defined an elephant, you'd have to specify that elephants are alive when shown a taxadermy elephant. Continually redefining the rule is not a good way to define something because it will never converge and stop changing and there are exeptions (an elephant that has had its tusks cut off and poached is still an elephant). Therefore, it seems that logical definitions are a poor model ot categorize things."
